# DEPair

---

DEPair evaluates ligand-receptor mediated crosstalks among cell populations. 
A interaction score as well as its significance is given for each pair of clusters with DEPair.
DEPair also identifies the variable interactions between different groups.

DEPair is still under development. We call for developers participating in this projects.

## Development plan

- [x] crosstalk intensity evaluation 
- [ ] crosstalk intensity evaluation parallelization
- [x] permutation-based crosstalk significance calculation
- [ ] permutation speed up
- [x] human and mouse ligand-receptor databases
- [ ] ligand-receptor databases for other species
